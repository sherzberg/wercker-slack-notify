[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/6077bdbf04300a6412268672fa39e71b/m "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/6077bdbf04300a6412268672fa39e71b)

# slack-notify

Send a message to a [Slack Channel](https://slack.com/).

### required

* `token` - Your Slack token.
* `channel` - The channel name of the Slack Channel (without the #).
* `subdomain` - The slack subdomain.

You can create a slack token by going to the account page on your slack domain:
`<your-subdomain>.slack.com/services` and click 'add New Integration' and select
'incoming webhooks'. Copy your token (as can be found in the example curl
command) and don't forget to click 'Add Integration'.

This token can be used directly in the wercker.yml (not
recommended) or better: as an environment variable. You can add environment
variables to wercker, by going to the settings tab of your application.
In the `pipeline` section you can add environment variables. You can use
those environment variables in the [wercker.yml](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/)
just as you would normally in a shell script (with a dollar sign in front of it).

Example
--------

Add `SLACK_TOKEN` as deploy target or application environment variable.


    build:
        after-steps:
            - sherzberg/slack-notify:
                subdomain: slacksubdomain
                token: $SLACK_TOKEN
                channel: general
